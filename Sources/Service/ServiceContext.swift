/// A context object that manages service resolution and dependency tracking.
/// This class is responsible for resolving services while preventing circular dependencies
/// and tracking the resolution depth to avoid infinite recursion.
///
/// The context uses TaskLocal storage to maintain thread-safe access across async contexts
/// and tracks the current resolution chain to detect circular dependencies.
///
/// Usage example:
/// ```swift
/// struct OrderProcessor: ServiceKey {
///     static func build(with context: ServiceContext) -> OrderProcessorProtocol {
///         let paymentService = context.resolve(PaymentService.self)
///         let inventoryService = context.resolve(InventoryService.self)
///         let logger = context.resolve(LoggerService.self)
///
///         return OrderProcessorImpl(
///             payment: paymentService,
///             inventory: inventoryService,
///             logger: logger
///         )
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// - Service caching based on scope
    /// - Dependency chain tracking
    ///
    /// - Parameter key: The ServiceKey type to resolve.

    /// - Note: This method will terminate the program if circular dependencies or
    ///         excessive resolution depth are detected.
