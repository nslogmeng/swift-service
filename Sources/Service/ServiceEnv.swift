/// Represents a service environment that manages service registration, resolution, and lifecycle.
/// Each environment maintains its own isolated service registry and storage, allowing for
/// different configurations in different contexts (e.g., production, testing, development).
///
/// The environment uses TaskLocal storage to ensure thread-safe access to the current environment
/// across async contexts. Service resolution supports parameterized services via HashableKey.
///
/// Usage example:
/// ```swift
/// func testUserService() async {
///     await ServiceEnv.$current.withValue(.dev) {
///         // All services resolved in this block use dev environment
///         let userService = UserService()
///         let result = userService.createUser(name: "Test User")
///         XCTAssertNotNil(result)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
