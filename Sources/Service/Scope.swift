/// Defines the lifecycle and caching behavior of service objects within the current environment storage.
/// Scopes determine how long service instances are kept alive and when they should be released.
///
/// The scope system provides several predefined scopes with different lifecycle characteristics:
/// - `.shared`: Singleton behavior, cached until explicitly reset
/// - `.graph`: Cached within dependency resolution graph only
/// - `.transient`: Never cached, always creates new instances
/// - `.weak`: Cached with weak references, released when no strong references exist
///
/// Usage example:
/// ```swift
/// struct MyService: ServiceKey {
///     static var scope: Scope { .shared } // Singleton database connection
///     
///     static func build(with context: ServiceContext) -> MyServiceProtocol {
///         return MyService()
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// Use this for expensive-to-create services that should be reused across the application.
    public static let shared = Scope(id: "shared", factory: SharedScopeStorage.init)
    
    /// Graph scope: Service instances are cached only within the current dependency resolution graph.
    /// This is the default scope and provides good performance while avoiding memory leaks.
    public static let graph = Scope(id: "graph", factory: GraphScopeStorage.init)
    
    /// Transient scope: Service instances are never cached, always creating new instances.
    /// Use this for lightweight, stateless services or when you need fresh instances every time.
    public static let transient = Scope(id: "transient", factory: TransientScopeStorage.init)
    
    /// Weak scope: Service instances are cached with weak references.
    /// Instances are automatically released when no strong references exist elsewhere.

    /// A unique identifier for this scope.
